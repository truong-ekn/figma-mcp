# R&D Figma MCP

## Summary of Figma MCP capabilities

> ðŸ’¡ Must use the Figma Desktop app

- Helps developers generate code from selected frame by select a Figma frame and write a prompt.
- Extracts design content by pulling in variables, components, and layout data directly into the IDE. Useful for design systems and component-based workflows.
- Retrieves Make resource from Make files and provide them to the LLM as context. This can help as you move from prototype to production application.
- Keeps the design system components consistent with Code Connect by reusing the actual components. Code Connect keeps the generated code consistent with the codebase.

## Tools and prompts

By default, the generated code is **React + Tailwind** stack, but can be customizable.

### get_code:

Get code from Figma Selection

> ðŸ’¡ We donâ€™t have to paste links, just select the frame or component in Figma before prompting.

- Change framework and stack:
  - `generate my Figma selection in Twig/Liquid template`
  - `generate my Figma selection in plain HTML + CSS`
  - `generate my Figma selection in React + SCSS`
- Use your components:
  We can set up Code Connect for best code reuse results.
  - `generate my Figma selection using components from src/components/ui`
- Combine both:
  - `generate my Figma selection using components from src/components/ui and style with SCSS`

### get_variable_defs (local only)

Returns the variables and styles used in your Figma selection (such as colors, spacing, typography).

- List all tokens used:
  - `get the variables used in my Figma selection`
- Focus on a specific type:
  - `what color and spacing variables are used in my Figma selection?`
- Get both names and values:
  - `list the variable names and their values used in my Figma selection`

### **create_design_system_rules**

A tool for creating a rule file that provide agents with the right context to translate designs into high-quality, codebase-aware frontend code. It helps ensure alignment with your design system and tech stack, improving the relevance and accuracy of generated output.

> ðŸ’¡ Run this tool and make sure the result is saved to the correct `rules/` or `instructions/` path so your agent can access it during code generation.

## How to get the best output

> Specify the exact tool you need in your prompt for best results

### Structure Figma design

1. **Use components with common UI parts for better reuse purpose**
2. **Link components to real code using Code Connect**
3. **Use Figma variables for tokens like spacing, color, radius, and typography**
4. **Name layers and components with clear semantic/intent-driven labels**
5. **Use Auto Layout to avoid absolute positioning**
6. **Use annotations and dev resources (coming soon) to convey design intent thatâ€™s hard to visualize from UI alone (how things behave and respond)**

### Write effective prompts to guide the AI

First, we should list out **what a good prompt can do**:

- Align the result with the right **framework or styling system**
- Align with **codebase conventions** (file structure, naming, layout)
- Generate code in the correct **file path** (like `src/pages`, `components/ui`)
- Add or modify code **inside existing files** instead of creating new ones
- Follow specific **layout systems** (flexbox, grid, absolute)

Some examples:

- `Generate React code from the selected Figma frame and style it with SCSS`
- `Implement the selected frame using Twig components`
- `Generate this using components from src/components/ui`
- `Add this component to src/components/marketing/PricingCard.tsx`
- `Implement this using our Stack layout component`

> ðŸ’¡ The more specific your prompt, the better the output. The clearer your intent, the more likely you'll get exactly what you need.

### Add custom rules based on your design system

Check your IDE or MCP client's documentation for how to structure rules, and experiment to find what works best for your team.

### Avoid selecting large, heavy frames

Break screens into smaller parts for faster, more reliable results.

Large selections can **slow the tools down**, **cause errors**, or result in **incomplete responses**, especially when there's too much context for the model to process. Instead:

1. Generate code for **smaller sections or individual components** (e.g. `Card`, `Header`, `Sidebar`)
2. **If it feels slow or stuck, reduce your selection size and try again**

> ðŸ’¡ Revisit the basics if the output doesnâ€™t look right or align with your system design:
>
> - how the Figma file is structured
> - how the prompt is written
> - and what context is being sent
